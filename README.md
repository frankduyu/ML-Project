# Face Detection Algorithm
## Project Summary
The project is to detect human face in image.
For now, the code can only detect one face in picture.


## Files Introduction
face_detection_parameter.pickle:
Store parameters used in algorithm.

train_dataset_LBPH.ipynb:
Process of using training dataset to extract parameters.

test_data: Folder that contains images to test. 
Users can put their image in folder and run code with image name to test their own image.

training_data: Folder that contains training dataset.

test_result: Folder that contains test result of image in test_data folder.

## Instruction
Run the code like this:
